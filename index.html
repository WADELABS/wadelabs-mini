        <h2 id="what-heading">What Problem Are We Solving?</h2>
        <p>Millions of adults—especially people from low-income, rural, and justice-impacted backgrounds—never received real computer education. They’re handed phones, laptops, and apps, but no one explains how any of it works. That gap keeps them out of jobs, training, and opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Our Solution</h3>
        <p>Wadelabs adds a coaching layer on top of a familiar computer environment. As users click, type, and explore, an AI guide explains what’s happening, suggests next steps, and turns each action into a mini lesson. Instead of lectures, people learn by doing—inside a safe, structured digital space.</p>

      <section id="founder" class="panel wrap" aria-labelledby="founder-heading">
        <h2 id="founder-heading">Founder</h2>
        <p>I’m a Louisiana student rebuilding my life after incarceration. I grew up around people who never had access to modern tech or the logic behind it. When I discovered AI and cloud computing, I realized the tools were never the problem—lack of comprehension was. I’m now completing a Bachelor’s in Cloud Computing and building Wadelabs as the guide I wish I had years ago.</p>
        <p class="mobile-short">I’m a Louisiana student and justice-impacted founder. I’m finishing a Cloud Computing degree and building Wadelabs so people who never learned computers can finally understand and use them with confidence.</p>

      <section id="impact" class="panel wrap" aria-labelledby="impact-heading">
        <h2 id="impact-heading">Who Wadelabs Is For</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Adults who never had formal computer training</li>
          <li>People returning from prison or long gaps in the workforce</li>
          <li>Low-income and rural learners without tech mentors</li>
          <li>Community colleges, re-entry programs, and nonprofits that need a simple, guided way to teach digital skills</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
        <p>Wadelabs will grow into a platform that institutions can deploy in labs, re-entry programs, and community centers to deliver consistent, high-quality digital literacy training—powered by AI, grounded in real life.</p>

      <section id="support" class="panel wrap" aria-labelledby="support-heading">
        <h2 id="support-heading">How Support Helps</h2>
        <p class="for-scholarships">I’m studying full-time while building the first working version of Wadelabs. Support helps cover basic living costs, hosting, and development tools so I can focus on finishing my Cloud Computing degree and launching a usable prototype for early partners.</p>
        <p class="for-investors">Funding accelerates development of the Wadelabs prototype, early user testing with community partners, and the research needed to turn this into a scalable platform for re-entry programs, adult education, and workforce training.</p>
